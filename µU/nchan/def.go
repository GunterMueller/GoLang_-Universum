// Pre: a is of the type of x.
// Returns nil, if a is sent on x (resp. if x is a 1:n channel and
// the calling process is a server, on the actual subchannel of x)
// to the communication partner of the calling process.
// Returns otherwise an appropriate error.

// Returns a slice of bytes, if x was created by New with nil as first argument.
// In this case, the client is responsible for decoding that slice,
// according to the type of what was sent.
// Otherwise, i.e. if x is bound to a type:
// Returns the object of the type of x, that was received on x (resp. if
// x is a 1:n channel and the calling process is a server, on the actual
// subchannel of x) from the communication partner, if that was received;
// returns an empty object otherwise.
// The calling process was blocked, until an object was received.
  Recv() any

// The port used by x is not used by a network service on the calling host.

// h0 always denotes the name of the host running the calling process.

// For both constructors for the first parameter a the following holds:
//      For a == nil, arbitrary objects of Codelen <= 1<<32 can be passed.
//      In this case, calls of Recv() return only slices of bytes, so
//      it is up to the receiver to Decode the object wanted to receive.

// Pre: h is contained in /etc/hosts or resolvable per DNS.
//      me != i; me is the identity of h0 and i is the identity of h
//      (me, i < number of hosts involved).
//      p > 0; p is not used on h0 or h by a network service.
//      The communication partner calls New with
//      - an object of the same type as the type of a as 1st argument
//        and an identical value of the port,
//      - the values of me and i reversed and h0 as 4th argument.
// Returns a asynchronous 1:1 channel for messages of the type of a
// between h0 and h over port p.
// p is now used on h0 and h by a network service.
