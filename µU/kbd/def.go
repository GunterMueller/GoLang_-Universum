/* We distinguish between three groups of keys to operate and control a system
   with keyboard and mouse:
   - character-keys (with echo in form of an alphanumerical character on the screen)
     to enter texts and numbers,
   - command-keys
     to induce particular reactions of the system and
   - mouse-buttons and -movements
     to navigate on the screen.
   In order to abstract from concrete keyboards or mouses,
   the following commands are provided for the last two groups: */

  None = Comm(iota)       // to distinguish between character- and command-keys,
                          // see specification of "Read"
  Esc                     // to leave the system (or a part of it) or to reject
  Enter                   // to confirm or to leave an input
  Back                    // to move backwards in the system
  Left; Right; Up; Down   // to move the cursor on the screen and
  PgLeft; PgRight; PgUp; PgDown // to move in the system, e.g. in a screen mask,
  Pos1; End               // in the corresponding direction
  Tab                     // for special purposes

/* Commands may be enforced in the "depth" of their "impact":
   Every command is associated with a natural number as its depth
   (0 as basic version, bigger numbers for greater depths).
   So we allow for commands with conceptionally equal effects
   but variable ranges of "move depth", as e.g. the movement
   in a text to the next character, word, sentence, paragraph or page,
   or in a calendar to the next day, week, month, year, decade.

   Commands of depth 0 are implemented by keys (without metakeys)
   or mouse-actions with system independent semantics:
   - Enter:                   input-key "Enter"/"Return"
   - Esc:                     stop-/break-key "Esc"
   - Back:                    backspace-key "<-"
   - Left, Right, Up, Down:   corresponding arrow-keys
   - PgUp, PgDown, Pos1, End: corresponding keys
   - Tab:                     Tabkey "|<- ->|"
   - Del, Ins:                corresponding keys
   - Help, Search:            F1-, F2-key
   - Act, Cfg:                F3-, F4-key
   - Mark, Unmark:            F5-, F6-key
   - Cut, Copy, Paste:        F7-, F8-, F9-key
   - Red, Green, Blue:        F10-, F11-, F12-key
   - Print, Roll, Pause:      corresponding keys
   - OnOff, Lower, Louder:    corresponding keys on laptops
   - Go:                      mouse moved with no button pressed
   - Here, This, That:        left, right, middle button pressed
   - Drag, Drop, Move:        mouse moved with corresponding button pressed
   - To, There, Thither:      corresponding button released
//   - Navigate:                3d-mouse used

   commands of depth > 0 by combination with metakeys:
   - depth 1:                 Shift- or Strg-key,
   - depth 2:                 Alt-key,
   - depth 3:                 Ctrl- and Alt-key.

   >>> Under X some meta-key/key-combinations are eaten up
       by the window-manager, e.g. with Esc, Tab and Back. */
