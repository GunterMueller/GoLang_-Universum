// Paths are sequences of names of directories in the file system tree
// - separated from each other by the separator "/" - in the direction
// from the root of the file system tree towards its leaves,
// where always the next directory is contained in the previous one.
// If the first character of a path is the separator, it starts
// in the root directory and is called an absolute Path,
// otherwise it starts in the actual directory.
// A separator at the end of a path does not matter,
// if the path is not only the root directory "/".
// The last directory of a path is called its base directory;
// the base directory of the path "/" is the root directory.
// Every calling process at any time is in exactly one directory,
// which is called the actual directory; the sequence of the
// directories from the root directory to the actual one
// is called the actual path, so the actual directory
// is always the base directory of the actual path.
//
// The empty string "" is also a path; its base directory
// is the actual directory. It is equivalent with "./".
// For a path p and a directory d in p, "p/d/.." is
// equivalent with "p/": both denote the same path.

// Otherwise the actual directory has changed as follows:
// For p == ".." the actual directory is now that one,
// in which the former actual directory was contained;
